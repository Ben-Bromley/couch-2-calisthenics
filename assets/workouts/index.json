Hang from a pullup bar with hands outside shoulder width and legs straight. Draw your shoulder blades back and together and arch your back to swing your body forward a bit.

        "body": "Perform each exercise for 30 seconds straight. Do NOT rest between exercises. Complete 1 round.\n\n1. Hold a handstand for 30 seconds. You can do the handstand using a wall for support. Place your hands about six inches back from the wall and get into a downward dog pose. Step one foot toward the wall and then kick your back leg up while focusing your eyes on the floor in front of you. Press into your hands and straighten your body with your heels against the wall.\n\n2. Jump squats\n\n3. Wall push ups. Get into pushup position in front of a wall and walk your feet up the wall behind you. Press your feet into the wall to create tension throughout your body, and perform pushups.\n\n4. Kick up push ups. Sit on the floor and roll backward, as if doing a reverse somersault. Stop when your feet face the ceiling and reverse the direction quickly, performing a kickup — kick your feet up and forward so you launch off the floor and land in a deep squat. From there, drop into a pushup.\n\n5. Squat position move side to side. Get into a low squat and step side to side. Take two steps one direction and then switch directions.\n\n6. X’s and O’s core workout. Lie on your back on the floor and extend your arms and legs to form an X-shape. Crunch and draw your knees to your chest, hugging them with your arms.\n\n7. Dips\n\n8.
